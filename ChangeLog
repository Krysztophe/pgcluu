2013-11-18 - Version 1.0 released

This is the first public release of pgCluu, that is a packaging of the tools I
use every day to collect statistics and build reports of PostgreSQL Clusters
for performances auditing and troubleshooting.

At this time it collect and report most of what is helpful for a PostgreSQL
Cluster performance auditing. There's lot of others reports to be included:

	- Statistics reports concerning tables.
	- Statistics reports about pg_stat_statement.
	- More Sar statistiques reports.
	- ...

This will comes in next release. 

The goal of this project is to provide a complete PostgreSQL auditing tool that
do not need any dependency so that it can be run on any server.

If you just have a sar output file, pgCluu can be use to draw graphs about the
system utilization only.
