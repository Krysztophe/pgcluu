2019-10-29 - Version 3.1 released

This release is a maintenance release that adds support to PostgreSQL
v12.0. It also add a new report:

  * Add report of extended statistics in report Table Statistics per
    database. Example:
    
        Table         | Extended Statistic
        public.cities | CREATE STATISTICS sch1.t1_stat (dependencies)
                                  ON city,country FROM public.cities;

It also fixes some issues reported by users since last month:

  - Fix some typos in documentation. Thanks to Justin Pryzby for the
    report.
  - Replace obsolete pg_constraint.consrc in PostgreSQL v12 by a call
    to function pg_get_constraintdef(). Thanks to seadba and Devrim
    Gunduz for the report.


2019-09-18 - Version 3.0 released

This release is a major release that adds lot of improvement and
new reports. It also improve performances and fully support a CGI
mode with dynamic content for realtime reports.

New or enhanced reports/features:

  * The CGI mode to provide dynamic reports on time selection is now
    production ready and has left the beta stage. See documentation
    on how to enable it. Debian packaging enable this mode by default.
  * Installation and configuration is fully managed from Makefile.PL
    script. This will help distribution packaging with additional
    configuration directives to control the behavior of pgcluu scripts
    with generic systemd service and timer files. 
  * Add incremental mode to pgcluu. That mean that you don't have to
    remove the content of the report directory anymore before running
    pgcluu again and when pgcluu detect that you are running in this
    mode. The incremental mode is detected from statistic directory
    when you have used the --rotate-daily or --rotate-hourly option
    to pgcluu_collectd.
  * Rewrite Stats I/O reports to display read/hit per table or indexes
    during the audit period reported.
  * Move Xlog (Wal bytes written) report under replication menu as
    data comes from pg_stat_replication.
  * Explode System and Cluster reports into several reports dedicated
    files to limit the size of the HTML files in incremental mode.
  * Add collect and report of vm.nr_overcommit_hugepages.
  * Add report on pages scanned to report number of pages scanned by
    the kswapd daemon and number of pages scanned directly per second
    (pgscank/s and pgscand/s). It also reports the number of pages
    the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and swapcache) per
    second to satisfy its memory demands (pgsteal/s). On a second
    axis %vmeffto reports the the efficiency of page reclaim.
  * All pages reports have been moved as sub menu of the Page menu and
    pgfree has been removed from the page fault report.
  * Limit system cache statistics report to pgpgin/s and pgpgout/s and
    a new report is dedicated to Page fault statistics with majflt/s,
    minflt/s and pgfree/s dataset. Dataset minflt/s is calculated from
    sar output as result of "fault/s - majflt/s".
  * All statistics about pg_stat_user_* and pg_stat_xact_user_* views
    are now stored as a snapshot at start and at end of the audit
    period and each hour if you are running in incremental mode. The
    old behavior was to append the snapshot at each running interval
    to the data file but this is not necessary and this can use huge
    disk space if you have lot of table and indexes in your database.
    Backward compatibility is preserved.
  * New report of json versus jsonb columns in each database.
  * Add keepalive kernel configuration in SysInfo report.
  * Separate bgwriter "allocated" buffers in a dedicated report for
    better reading.
  * Add new report about estimated memory workload based on the value
    of Committed_AS from /proc/meminfo. Committed_AS is the total
    amount of memory estimated to complete the workload. This value
    represents the worst case scenario value, and also includes swap
    memory. The report show the memory workload aver the time.

New command line options:

  - Add option -x, --external-menu to pgcluu to save the common menu
    in menu.html and load it into each report using w3-include-html
    attribute from w3.js. This will only work if access to HTML report
    is through a Web server, not using the file:// protocol.
  - Add new option --retention to pgcluu to set number of rolling days
    to keep in report directory. Default is to store indefinitely.
  - Add option --retention NDAYS to pgcluu_collectd to set the number
    of rolling days to keep in data directory in incremental mode.
    Default is to store indefinitely.

New configuration directives :

  * Add configuration directive STATS_REPORT_CACHING to pgcluu.conf
    file. This directive must be enabled in CGI mode. In this case the
    pgcluu script must be run periodically at least each 5 minutes to
    build and update cached statistics. In cache mode pgcluu generate
    binary file in the statistics directory and nothing in the report
    directory. The pgcluu.service and pgcluu.timer can be use, pgcluu
    will read the configuration file and switch automatically to cache
    mode if STATS_REPORT_CACHING is enabled.

  * Add MAX_RENDERED_DAYS configuration directive to set the maximum
    number of days in a graph. Using default pgcluu_collectd 1 minute
    interval each, daily graph will have 1440 points. Having too much
    data to render is not a good point for performances with the
    current code. The user can set is own graph period, default is to
    limit to the first seven days of the selected period. This mean a
    maximum of 10080 points for one week, this seems a safe limit.

It also fixes some issues reported by users since last five months:

  - New report on memory workload based on values of Committed_AS from
    /proc/meminfo. Thanks to Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais for the
    feature request.
  - Separate bgwriter "allocated" buffers in a dedicated report.
    Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
  - Use MASK to 0022 for directory and file creation and add a note
    about securing the stats repository in the source code.
    It can be changed to 0027 if you want to secure the data directory
    Note that in CGI mode the www-data user or group need read access
    to all files in the stat directory. The systemd service files take
    care of setting the privilege for the postgres and www-data users.
  - Make perlcritic more happy.
  - Try to handle automatically systemd RPM specific path in install
    process (/lib/systemd/system/).
  - Update resources files minimization.
  - Fix declaration of config file.
  - Change Perl installation paths to be vendor paths by default and
    adapt path replacement by DESTDIR.

    defined with Makefile.PL.
  - The configuration file pgcluu.conf is now auto-generated by script
    Makefile.PL
  - Add support to some new environment variables to fully customize
    the installation paths (HTMLDIR,CGIDIR,CONFDIR,PIDDIR,DATADIR,
    APACHECONF,MANDIR,DOCDIR,SYSTEMDDIR,RETENTION). Default are:
    
            DESTDIR     => /usr/local
            INSTALLDIRS => site
            CONFDIR     => DESTDIR/etc
            PIDDIR      => /var/run
            DATADIR     => /var/lib/pgcluu/data
            HTMLDIR     => DESTDIR/share/pgcluu
            CGIDIR      => /usr/lib/cgi-bin
            APACHECONF  => /etc/apache2/conf-available
            MANDIR      => DESTDIR/share/man
            DOCDIR      => DESTDIR/share/doc
            SYSTEMDIR   => DESTDIR/lib/systemd/system
            RETENTION   => 0
    
    If INSTALLDIRS is set to 'vendor':
    
            CONFDIR     => /etc
            DESTDIR     => /usr
    
    The configuration file is auto-generated by the Makefile.PL script
    and saved into CONFDIR/pgcluu.conf. If the destination file exists
    it is not overridden. The file is saved as example in directory
    DOCDIR/pgcluu/examples/pgcluu.conf.dist
    
    The man page is saved as DESTDIR/share/man/pgcluu.1p.gz and a
    symbolic link pgcluu_collectd.1p.gz is created to this file. The
    documentation, README, changelog.gz, LICENSE files are saved under
    DESTDIR/share/doc/.
    
    For the CGI mode, resources (css & js files from the cgi-bin/rsc)
    are saved under the DESTDIR/share/pgcluu/rsc directory. The CGI
    script is saved under /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi. The Apache
    configuration file under /etc/apache2/conf-available/pgcluu.conf
    with a symbolic link /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/pgcluu.conf created
    to this file. Its content: 

            Alias /pgcluu HTMLDIR/
            <Directory HTMLDIR/>
                Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Require local
                #Require ip 192.1.168.0/24
            </Directory>
    
    The systemd files (pgcluu_collectd.service, pgcluu.service and
    pgcluu.timer) are saved as examples into DOCDIR/pgcluu/examples/
    and into the systemd directory SYSTEMDDIR/
    
    The right path to the configuration file is set into all scripts
    pgcluu, pgcluu_collectd and pgcluu.cgi. The path where the pid
    file must be saved is replaced into pgcluu_collectd with the value
    of PIDFILE variable.
  - Enable configuration reading to pgcluu_collectd. The configuration
    directive supported by this script is STATS_COLLECTD_RETENTION. It
    is used to set the retention limit in the statistics directory
    expressed in number of days. This directive is only used by script
    pgcluu_collectd in incremental mode. Only the last number of days
    will be preserved, obsolete directories will be removed. It can be
    used to preserved disk space. Default store indefinitely.
  - Enable configuration reading to script pgcluu. The configuration
    directive supported by this script is STATS_REPORT_RETENTION. It
    is used to set the retention limit in static html report directory
    expressed in number of days. This directive is only used by pgcluu
    in incremental mode. Only last number of days will be preserved,
    obsolete directories will be removed. It can be used to preserved
    disk space. Default store indefinitely.
  - Fix some uninitialized variables during report generation of
    pg_stat_user_tables and pg_stat_user_indexes.
  - Set default configuration file path to /etc/pgcluu.conf and no
    more /usr/local/etc/pgcluu.conf
  - Change $CONFIG_FILE declaration in CGI script.
  - Update copyright year.
  - Limit number of days to process for a single time period
    controlled by configuration directive MAX_RENDERED_DAYS.
  - Disable Year and Month time selector for the moment, this is too
    much data to render with the actual implementation of pgcluu.cgi
  - Separate cluster / database actions.
  - Only display latest information in CGI mode for all database
    table and index reports that reports a list of statistics.
    These informations can not be cumulated over time selection.
  - Add map between actions and binary file to only load relevant
    files
  - Improve report generation by reading only required data.
  - Prevent reading sar stat from data file when already read from
    binary file.

    term. Obsolete statistics can be removed using new command line
    option '--retention ndays' with pgcluu_collectd.
  - Update documentation about pgcluu_collectd --retention option.
    Thanks to Christoph Courtois for the feature request.
  - Document sorttable license. The license is called X11 in the

2018-12-13 - Version 2.9 released

This release is a minor release that fix a major issue in the
interval detection. This This led to a bad scale in bg_writter,
replication and most database statistics reports. Everybody must
upgrade immediately.

It also fixes some issues reported by users since last release:

  - Improve devices list retrieving and fix several menu issues.
  - Fix checkpoint counter legend.
  - Move query in pg_stat_statements at the right of the table for
    better readability.
  - Fix report of disk use, mounted devices, running processes,
    crontab and installed package to avoid duplicate entries.
  - Empty SysInfo arrays before reading sysinfo file, this prevent
    duplicate data.
  - Improve parsing of sar file.
  - Fix interval that was set in milliseconds instead of second.
    This conduct to wrong scale (ex: Kb instead of Gb) in bg_writter,
    replication and database statistics reports. Thanks to Guillaume
    Lelarge for the report.

2018-11-28 - Version 2.8 released

This release is a minor release that fix some issues reported by
users over past months, it also adds some new reports:

  - Add disk space utilization report over time using df command
    for sysstat version older than 11.1.4.
  - Add report of percentage of disk space and inode used on each
    file system. The information is available in sar output since
    11.1.4 version. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the feature
    report.
  - Add PageTables information in SysInfo memory report.
  - Show database information about table/indexes in capture mode.
  - Add report of number of tasks currently blocked, waiting for I/O
    to complete "Run queue" report.
  - Add new report about system dirty memory that need to be written
    to disk as well as amount of active/inactive memory.
  - Show highest dirty memory to write and highest number of processes
    blocked in overall stats page.
  - Add report of crontab entries for the user running pgcluu.
  - Add report of installed PostgreSQL packages in main page.

New pgcluu_collectd command line option:

  - Add command line option --package-list to be able to set a custom
    command to list PostgreSQL packages. Default is to auto-detect
    package type between rpm and dpkg, using command 'rpm -qa' or
    'dpkg -l'. If you have an other system you can use this option to
    set a custom command. A filter on keyword 'postgres' is appended
    to the command: ' | grep postgres'.

Here are the complete list of bug fixes in this release:

  - Change the way sysstat version is checked and save the version
    into to sysinfo.txt file for use in pgcluu script.
  - Remove extra new line at end of data file generated by the
    patch on search_path securing.
  - Add collect of disk space and inode used over time stored in file
    fs_stat_use.csv. Need more work to avoid duplicate data with new
    versions of sar that already report fs space use.
  - Replace all call to Perl ternary operator with usual if-then-else
    statement. In some condition this operator do not works and makes
    pgcluu return negative values in overall stats. This was happening
    only when pgcluu encounter a stat reset in the data files. Thanks
    to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
  - Remove /dev/loop from devices statistics report.
  - Add PageTables information in SysInfo memoryb report. Thanks to
    Adrien Neyrat for the patch.
  - Remove some unwanted metrics displayed in capture mode.
  - Show database information about table/indexes in capture mode.
  - Exclude /dev/loop from result of "df" command and squashfs from
    "mount -l" command.
  - Prevent pgcluu_collectd to stop before that all metrics collected
    from the current loop have been written to disk. When it receives
    the terminate signal (-k option) it previously stops immediately,
    the problem was that this can conduct to empty or incomplete data
    file. Now it waits until the loop is terminated before exiting.
  - Fix compression of hourly directory when -R | --rotate-hourly and
    -z | --compress options are enabled. The compression was called
    each loop and not at each hour rotation.
  - Add warning about mandatory use of -d option when pg_buffercache
    reports are enabled (-B) but pg_buffercache extention is not found
    in the connection database.
  - Fix missing buffercache statistics since secure path has been
    included in commit b61bf44. This required that pg_buffercache
    table call was prefixed by the public schema. Thanks to
    lobojohnson for the report.
  - Fix unwanted print of tablespace path in cluster reports.
  - Remove not useful information in buffercache graph legends.
  - CSS: Increase size of the sysinfo panel.
  - Adapt automatically pgCluu to changes in sar sysstat tool since
    version 11.5.7. As per sysstat commit 8d635e0: Replace "rd_sec/s"
    and "wr_sec/s" fields with "rkB/s" and "wkB/s". These fields are
    now expressed in kilobytes instead of sectors. Replace "avgrq-sz"
    field with "areq-sz". This field is now expressed in kilobytes
    instead of sectors. Rename "avgqu-sz" field to "aqu-sz" to make
    it consistent with iostat's output.
  - Add report of number of tasks currently blocked, waiting for I/O
    to complete to "Run queue" report. This information is available
    with sysstat >= 9.1.7
  - Show also highest dirty memory to write and highest number of
    processes blocked in main page.
  - Add new report about system dirty memory that need to be written
    to disk as well as amount of active/inactive memory. These metrics
    are available in recent sar/sysstat versions.
  - Add report of crontab entries.
  - Change icon for packages report.
  - Add report of PostgreSQL installed package in main page.
  - Add storage information about PostgreSQL packages installed on
    the system.
  - Add command line option --package-list to be able to set a custom
    command to list PostgreSQL packages. Default is to auto-detect
    package type between rpm and dpkg, using command 'rpm -qa' or
    'dpkg -l'. If you have an other system you can use this option to
    set a custom command. A filter on keyword 'postgres' is appended
    to the command: ' | grep postgres'.

Here are the complete list of bug fixes in this release:

  - Finalize systemd unit files. pgcluu_collectd.service is used to

    and pgcluu.timer to execute pgcluu periodically to generate reports.
  - Add import of missing jqplot.canvasAxisLabelRenderer.min.js file used
    to render axis labels in graphs.
  - Set logo and icon on a single line in an url attribute as chrome
    complain that it will be obsolete in M60.

    the different days. Thanks to Heath Yob for the feature request.
  - Add verification that pg_stat_statement is loaded from
    shared_preload_libraries.
  - Fix incomplete per-database-statistics. Thanks to Markus Braunig
    for the report.
  - Add kernel scheduler configuration for sched_autogroup_enabled
    and sched_migration_cost_ns to sysinfo report. Thanks to Adrien
    Nayrat for the patch.
  - Fix broken main menu when no disk devices was present in sar
    report.
  - Allow to set label for y2axis in create_linegraph() parameters
  - Change parameters and return of the get_diff() method to support
    incremental mode.
  - Create function get_diff() and shows_diff() to report
    configuration file change.
  - Append new color for line graph.
  - Set missing database list with sysinfo and about menu.

    from file each time.
  - Fix detection of working directories with dates over two months.
  - Fix runqueue size report. Thanks to Thomas Reiss for the report.
  - Create function to reuse the look for sysinfo file.
  - pgcluu CGI now append new csv statistic to cached binary files.
  - The menu is now built at end to avoid reading csv files first to
    look for database, disk device and network interface.
  - The CGI home page is now just built from the binary files to
    speed up the first screen. As we do not append last data collected
    from the csv files we indicate at which time the cache was last
    built. This is to give a quick snapshot of the dashboard. When
    looking at the statistics binary and csv files are both read.
    If the cache have not been run yet, pgcluu will read dashboard
    statistics from data fileis which takes longer to display.
  - Allow incremental cache. When running in cache mode pgcluu will
    append new csv statistics to old cached binary files. Then when
    building reports, pgcluu will first load statistics from binary
    files and complete statistics with data from csv file collected
    after the last cache mode run. This mean that if cache mode is
    run each minute on an incremental statistics collect (see option
    -r or -R of pgcluu_collectd), pgcluu is able to create report very
    quickly at any time. This is especially useful with CGI mode where
    a full day statistics report can be displayed in few seconds.
  - Fix diff of configuration files, old and new files was inversed.
    Thanks to Adrien Nayrat for the report.
  - Fix display of message no dataset on empty graphs.
  - Update description of temporary files report and statistics
    on checkpoints.
  - Rewrite use of interval between collected data to support change
    during collecting. Interval is now always calculated from the
    difference between the current line end the previous line. This
    mean that the first line is never present in reports with per
    second statistics.
  - Fix formatting of bytes in pretty number.
  - Improve storage of database list with huge number of database.
  - Fix timezone on all reports and remove graph per tablespace and
    replace them with a list of tablespace and their location.
  - Fix timezone on start and end timestamp of collect. Remove graph
    per tablespace and replace them with a list of tablespace and
    their location.
  - Clear Start/End input box at startup in CGI.
  - Comment and include REVERT_DATE toogle about sar date format
    in CGI configuration file.
  - Fix timezone and time selector in javascript menu.
  - Fix use of timezone and date detection in sa file.
  - Fix date parsing from sa text file.
  - Fix some warning about use of undefined variables.
  - Add link to last known statistics in CGI front page when no
    data are found.
  - Fix a call to timegm_nocheck()
  - Split set_overall_stat_from_binary() in two function, one for
    database orverall statistics and the other for system statistics.
  - Fix parsing of sa file.
  - Do not load statistic from the last day when hour:min is 00:00.
  - Fix some bugs when there is just sar cached binary files.
  - Fix two digit in date parts on start/end date.
  - Fix cache mode when there is just sar file in entry.
  - Add INCLUDE_DEV configuration directive to be able to filter
    disk device. Allow comma as list separator in configuration file.
  - Add information about how to parse sysstat sa binary and text file.
  - Fix remove of unlogged tables following pg version.
  - Fix colspan on unlogged table report.
  - Add report of transaction throughput per second.
  - Use psql -X option so .psqlrc doesn't get in the way. If .psqlrc
    contains for example \timing, pgcluu_collectd will get confused.
    Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.
  - Separate svctm/await dataset on two different axes.
  - Remove unwanted bgwriter stats prior pg 9.1
  - Add data checksum status to CGI report.
  - Fix autodetection of timezone and set default timezone for sar
    statistics to the result of
	perl -MPOSIX -e "print substr(strftime(\"%z\", localtime()), 0, 3);".
  - Replace javascript call to dateToDisplay.toGMTString() with
    dateToDisplay.toString(). Please note that this could not be
    backward compatible with your previous timezone settings. See
    pgcluu.js to revert the function call.
  - Fix an issue with --from-sa-file where date was still incremented.
    Thanks to Flavie Perette for the report.
  - Replace sadf -D option by -d to obtain a compatible output.
  - Separate svctm/await dataset on two different axes to be able to
    see both dataset.
  - Fix kernel parameter hugepage report when not available.
  - Fix all call of psql that use both -f - and -c that doe not have
    the same behavior in pg 9.6. Previous version does not care of
    the -f stdin input when a command was provided with -c. This not
    compatible anymore. Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.
  - Fix collect of lock in pg_stat_activity with PostgreSQL 9.6.
    Thanks to Vincent Laborie for the report.

2015-07-25 - Version 2.4 released

This release is a maintenance release that fix some issues. There's also some
new interesting reports:

  * Transfers per second (read/write/both) on all devices from sar -b
  * Transfers per second for each device from sar -d .
  * Number of tasks created per second
  * Number of context switches per seconds.
  * Improve pg_stat_statement report by adding all shared block stats
    and read/write I/O timing per query when track_io_timing is enabled.
  * Add device with highest tps on overall system information.

and useful features:

  * Add --capture mode to pgcluu_collectd to be be able to build a snapshot of
    the PostgreSQL instance and exit. pgCluu will automatically adapt the report
    to this capture mode. It will use a temporary directory /tmp/pgcluu_capture
    to generate a tarball /tmp/pgcluu_capture.tar.gz containing the capture.
  * Add pgCluu logo and ico to the html output.
  * Add --charset option to be able to change the html charset, default: utf8.
  * Allow regular expression in database list available in reports, for example:
    with --db-only "p.*", only database beginning with p will be reported.
  * Allow pgcluu to parse and compute statistics from gzip compressed files.
  * pgcluu will not stop anymore if the sar file is not found, it will only
    show a warning message and continue.

This release also adds -r | --rotate-daily and -R | --rotate-hourly options to
pgcluu_collectd be able to rotate statistic files on a daily or hourly basis.
You can use -z or --compress option to compress rotated data files. Thanks to
Euler Taveira de Oliveira for the feature request.

There also some code relative to next coming major release that will be used
to allow a full incremental mode and a temporal navigation into the collected
statistics from a CGI program. This code enable caching (option -C or --cache)
by dumping statistics stored in memory into binary files. With those files, data
files can be removed (automatically with option -c or --clean) and report can
be build later from them. This is not really useful now but this s the first
stage to build incremental and cumulative reports.

Here are the complete list of bug fixes in this release:

  - Fix pretty print number format when units are blocks and not sizes.
  - Do not apply database list restriction on total cluster size calculation.
  - Fix Statistics about I/O on Indexes.
  - Rewrite some parts of the overall system statistics for better performances.

2013-11-18 - Version 1.0 released

This is the first public release of pgCluu, that is a packaging of the tools I
use every day to collect statistics and build reports of PostgreSQL Clusters
for performances auditing and troubleshooting.

At this time it collect and report most of what is helpful for a PostgreSQL
Cluster performance auditing. There's lot of others reports to be included:

	- Statistics reports concerning tables.
	- Statistics reports about pg_stat_statement.
	- More Sar statistiques reports.
	- ...

This will comes in next release. 

The goal of this project is to provide a complete PostgreSQL auditing tool that
do not need any dependency so that it can be run on any server.

If you just have a sar output file, pgCluu can be use to draw graphs about the
system utilization only.

For more information take a look at http://pgcluu.darold.net/
