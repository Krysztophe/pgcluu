2015-07-25 - Version 2.4 released

This release is a maintenance release that fix some issues. There's also some
new interesting reports:

  * Transfers per second (read/write/both) on all devices from sar -b
  * Transfers per second for each device from sar -d .
  * Number of tasks created per second
  * Number of context switches per seconds.
  * Improve pg_stat_statement report by adding all shared block stats
    and read/write I/O timing per query when track_io_timing is enabled.
  * Add device with highest tps on overall system information.

and useful features:

  * Add --capture mode to pgcluu_collectd to be be able to build a snapshot of
    the PostgreSQL instance and exit. pgCluu will automatically adapt the report
    to this capture mode. It will use a temporary directory /tmp/pgcluu_capture
    to generate a tarball /tmp/pgcluu_capture.tar.gz containing the capture.
  * Add pgCluu logo and ico to the html output.
  * Add --charset option to be able to change the html charset, default: utf8.
  * Allow regular expression in database list available in reports, for example:
    with --db-only "p.*", only database beginning with p will be reported.
  * Allow pgcluu to parse and compute statistics from gzip compressed files.
  * pgcluu will not stop anymore if the sar file is not found, it will only
    show a warning message and continue.

This release also adds -r | --rotate-daily and -R | --rotate-hourly options to
pgcluu_collectd be able to rotate statistic files on a daily or hourly basis.
You can use -z or --compress option to compress rotated data files. Thanks to
Euler Taveira de Oliveira for the feature request.

There also some code relative to next coming major release that will be used
to allow a full incremental mode and a temporal navigation into the collected
statistics from a CGI program. This code enable caching (option -C or --cache)
by dumping statistics stored in memory into binary files. With those files, data
files can be removed (automatically with option -c or --clean) and report can
be build later from them. This is not really useful now but this s the first
stage to build incremental and cumulative reports.

Here are the complete list of bug fixes in this release:

  - Fix pretty print number format when units are blocks and not sizes.
  - Do not apply database list restriction on total cluster size calculation.
  - Fix Statistics about I/O on Indexes.

2013-11-18 - Version 1.0 released

This is the first public release of pgCluu, that is a packaging of the tools I
use every day to collect statistics and build reports of PostgreSQL Clusters
for performances auditing and troubleshooting.

At this time it collect and report most of what is helpful for a PostgreSQL
Cluster performance auditing. There's lot of others reports to be included:

	- Statistics reports concerning tables.
	- Statistics reports about pg_stat_statement.
	- More Sar statistiques reports.
	- ...

This will comes in next release. 

The goal of this project is to provide a complete PostgreSQL auditing tool that
do not need any dependency so that it can be run on any server.

If you just have a sar output file, pgCluu can be use to draw graphs about the
system utilization only.

For more information take a look at http://pgcluu.darold.net/
